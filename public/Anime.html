 <h1>Best most peak animanga of all time</h1>
 <h2>Below are the top three animanga I have ever seen/read</h2>
 <hr ->
<h3>Bleach</h3>
<p>An absolutely goated story by tite kubo following ichigo the protagonist and the protector. Lots of meaningful poems and beautiful art</p>
<h3>Mob Psycho 100</h3>
<p>This story follows Mob on his personal development as a person as well as his adventures as an OP psychic</p>
<h3>To your eternity</h3>
<p>An absolute tearjerker like the first anime to ever make me cry so many stories and people the development is crazy honestly should be called to your peak</p>
